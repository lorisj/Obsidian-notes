# Classes of errors
[[Error_Correction]]

**Def(Logical error):** $F \in \mathcal{N}(S)-S$. We call this type of error $F$ a logical error, because these types of errors are in fact logical operations on the encoded state. So for instance it could be that $\text{DEC}(F(\text{ENC})) = X$, so $F$ acting on the output space is the same thing as the NOT operator on the logical space. These errors cannot be corrected under any choice of syndrome.
