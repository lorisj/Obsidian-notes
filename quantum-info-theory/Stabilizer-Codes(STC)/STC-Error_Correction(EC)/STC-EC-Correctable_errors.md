## Correctable errors
How does error correction work? 
Answer: Syndrome Decoding

Suppose we have a stabilizer $S = <g_1,...g_l>$
and an encoded state $|\phi\rangle=\text{ENC}(|\psi\rangle)$ that has been corrupted by some error.
We wish to ask, what kinds of errors can be corrected?


**Thm(Correctable Errors):** Given a set $\mathcal{E}=\{E_i\}_i$ of errors, the stabilizer code generated by $S$ can correct $\mathcal{E}$ if and only if for any i,j: $E^\dagger E_j\notin \mathcal{N}(S)$  


[[STC-EC-Classes_of_Errors]]
Now consider 2 errors, $E \in \mathcal{N}(S)-S  \text{ (logical)}, F\in \mathcal{G}^n - \mathcal{N}(S)\text{ (not logical, but also not in }S)$
