$$\mathcal{G^n}=(G^n,*,*^{-1})=  \text{Arbitrary subgroup of } \mathcal{P^n}$$
$$S = \text{Arbitrary stabilizer} <\mathcal{G^n}$$
$$V_S = [n,k] \text{ stabilizer code generated by S}$$
## Error correction
How does error correction work? 
Answer: syndrome decoding

Suppose we have a stabilizer $S = <g_1,...g_l>$
and an encoded state $|\phi\rangle=\text{ENC}(|\psi\rangle)$ that has been corrupted by some error.
We wish to ask, what kinds of errors can be corrected?



**Def(Syndrome):** Given error $E$, the syndrome of E is a $n-k$ tuple, where each number corresponds to $\pm 1$, the eigenvalue of the $i$th generator of S. 
$$\text{Syndrome}(E)=(\lambda_i)_i, \text{ where } \lambda_i=\begin{cases}+1 & \text{if }E \text{ commutes with }g_i\\ -1& \text{ if } E \text{ anticommutes with } g_i\end{cases} $$

Note that measuring the error state across generator $g_i$ yields syndrome $\lambda_i$:
	Let $E|\psi\rangle$ be the error state ($|\psi\rangle \in V_S$). Consider 

Note that any operator $E\in \mathcal{N}(S)$ has syndrome $(1,1,...1)$, which follows from the definition of $\mathcal{N}(S)$


**Def(Logical error):** $F \in \mathcal{N}(S)-S$. We call this type of error $F$ a logical error, because these types of errors are in fact logical operations on the encoded state. So for instance it could be that $\text{DEC}(F(\text{ENC})) = X$, so $F$ acting on the output space is the same thing as the NOT operator on the logical space. These errors cannot be corrected under any choice of syndrome.

Now consider 2 errors, $E \in \mathcal{N}(S)-S, F\in \mathcal{G}^n - \mathcal{N}(S)$
