# Substructure and Isomorphic Structures
### Prerequisites

### Introduction

### Substructure definition
**Def(Substructure):** If $\mathcal{M,N}$ are $\mathcal{L}$ structures with $M\subseteq N$ and the inclusion map $\eta:M\to N$ acts as the identity on $M$ is an $\mathcal{L}$ embedding, then $\mathcal{M}$ is a substructure of $\mathcal{N}$. (sometimes written as either $\mathcal{M}<\mathcal{N}$ or simply $\mathcal{M}\subseteq \mathcal{N}$)

### Examples
**Ex(Substructures of groups):** Note that the notion of substructure is sensitive to the language $\mathcal{L}$. So for instance if $\mathcal{L_{\text{group}}}=\{e,\cdot\}$, then a substructure does not preserve inverses and therefore is not a group, however if $\mathcal{L_{\text{group}}}=\{e,\cdot,\cdot^{-1}\}$ then a substructure must preserve inverses and therefore would be a group.
