### Introduction

### Algorithm Definition
**Def(Algorithm):** An algorithm can come in 3 different forms:
1) Lambda calculus (by Church)
2) General recursive functions (by Godel, Herbrand)
3) Turing's finite tape machines (by Turing)
Church, Turing, Kleene Proved that these are the same.

### Church Turing Thesis
**Ths(Church Turing):** A function $\phi:\omega \to \omega$ is effectively computable (informally) if it is computable by a Turing machine.
