### Introduction
This folder contains notes on computability theory. We first define an algorithm informally, by saying that an algorithm is a finite set of instructions that can be followed to solve a problem. In 1900, David Hilbert published 23 problems to the ICM, and among these, an interesting one was his 10th problem:
**Def(Hilbert's 10th Problem):** Find an algorithm with input $p(x,y,\ldots w)$ over $\mathbb Z$ that determines if $p$ has a solution in $\mathbb Z$.

Years later in 1928 he added:
**Def(Entscheidungsproblem):** Find an algorithm that determines given a mathematical statement $P$ whether $P$ is provable.

As it turns out, both of these problems are unsolvable.
